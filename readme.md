# How to Contribute to PHPeste 2016

## About the conference

PHPeste is a PHP conference organized by the comunidades "cabra da peste" from the Brazilian Northeast. It's formed by 9 states, and is one of the biggest brazilian conferences.  Last year was our first, in Jo√£o Pessoa (PB). This time Salvador (BA) has the honor of hosting the event.

The conference will happen between October the 8th and October the 09th. This time of the year we have spring on our side and a beautiful city to visit and shake!

There will be two days of learning and hands on activities. The event will have international speakers, recognized names of the Brazilian community, and more than 16 hours of quality talks, minicourses, and hackathons focused on the event's theme: Growth and Collaboration.

This is not just another event for you to add to your CV. You will have the opportunity to make social connections and grow your network, experiencing an awesome time with people from the community, and this is why we need your help! This is an event by the community for the community.

# Why we need your help

We will be hosting the event at the IFBA (Federal Institute of Bahia), a federal school, so we can keep the costs down, but there are other costs involved. We've chosen the website [Benfeitoria](http://www.benfeitoria.com) to help with the fundraising part. This is a tutorial to help you non-Portuguese speakers know how to help us. The website doesn't require a % over the amount gathered. In the end _you_ can choose to donate to them or not.

Our goal is to raise __R$10,000.00__ to pay for speakers' travel arrangements, invest in the conference, and other costs involved.
