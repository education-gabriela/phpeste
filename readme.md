There will be two days of learning and hands on. The event will have international speakers, recognized names of the Brazilian community and more the 16h of quality talks, minicourses and hackathons focused on the event theme: growth and collaboration.

This is not just another event for you to add to your CV, you will do networking, experiment a awesome time with people from the community and this is why we need your help! Is an even from the community to the community.

# Why we need your help

We will be hosting the event on the IFBA (Federal Institute of Bahia), a federal school, so we can keep the costs down. However we chose the website [Benfeitoria](http://www.benfeitoria.com) to help with the fundraising part. This is a tutorial to help you non-Portuguese speaker to know how to help us. This website doesn't demand a % over the amount gathered, in the end _you_ can choose to donate to them or not.

Our goal is to raise __R$10,000.00__ to pay for speaker's travel arrangements, invest in the conference and other costs involved.
